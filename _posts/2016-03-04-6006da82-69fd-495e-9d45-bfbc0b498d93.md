70,000 years ago our world
experienced the most dramatic shift and disruptive innovation ever seen: evolution
- the greatest show on earth -
created the cognitive revolution and made humans develop an extraordinary capability. We became smart.

On the one hand this cognitive shift made possible an unprecedented development
of human societies, companies, cultures and sciences.
On the other hand our cogni-
tive abilities started a second
evolution, an evolution of
ideas which would progress a
lot faster than our biological
development. 

Today, we have created a
world in which our minds
can't keep up with the pace
of change around us. We are
using insufficient tools to
generate, evaluate and exe-
cute ideas. What once were
efficient mental shortcuts of
our minds to make decisions
have turned into systematically biased and often irrational strategies. In many sit-
uations our minds are no
longer our friends.
